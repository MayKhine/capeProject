## Cape Code House Sharing Project: Front End

This project is an app for booking Cape Cod House among family members. This is my first TypeScript + React + Vite project. I created it with `pnpm create vite@latest my-project-name --template react-ts`.

This project is just the front end. You will need to run the backend server from this [git] (https://github.com/MayKhine/capeProjectServer). Login password is 'abcd'.
